Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Filippo, a PhD student in the COSMO lab (EPFL, Switzerland). Previously, I was a student in Chemistry at the University of Oxford.

I work on applications of machine learning in physics, chemistry and materials science, with a focus on molecular dynamics and related methods.

Thanks for stopping by ðŸš€
